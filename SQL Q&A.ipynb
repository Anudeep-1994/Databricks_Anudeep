    "1. What is SQL?\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to\n",
    "interact with relational databases. It is used to store, retrieve, update, and delete\n",
    "data. SQL is also used to create and modify database structures such as tables,\n",
    "views, and indexes.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "SELECT * FROM Employees;\n",
    "This query retrieves all the records from the Employees table.\n",
    "Created by: Vinay Kumar Panika\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a Database?\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed\n",
    "electronically. It allows users to efficiently store, retrieve, update, and manage\n",
    "data. Databases are used to handle large amounts of information in various\n",
    "applications such as websites, business systems, and applications.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "A customer database in an e-commerce website may store customer details like\n",
    "name, email, contact number, and purchase history.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are the types of SQL commands?\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL commands are categorized into five types based on their functionality:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.DDL (Data Definition Language) – Defines the structure of the database.\n",
    "CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE\n",
    "\n",
    "2.DML (Data Manipulation Language) – Manages data stored in the database.\n",
    "SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE\n",
    "\n",
    "3.DCL (Data Control Language) – Controls access to the data.\n",
    "GRANT, REVOKE\n",
    "\n",
    "4.TCL (Transaction Control Language) – Manages transactions in the\n",
    "database.\n",
    "COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT\n",
    "\n",
    "5.DQL (Data Query Language) – Retrieves data from the database.\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is Primary Key?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Primary Key is a column or a combination of columns in a table that uniquely identifies\n",
    "each row in that table. It does not allow NULL values and must always contain unique\n",
    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniquely identifies each record\n",
    "Cannot have duplicate values\n",
    "Cannot contain NULL values\n",
    "Only one primary key is allowed per table\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "EmployeeName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "Age INT,\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "HERE EmployeeID IS THE PRIMARY KEY THAT UNIQUELY IDENTIFIES EACH RECORD OR EACH Employee IN THE TABLE\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is Foreign Key?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a column or combination of columns in one table that refers to the Primary\n",
    "Key in another table. It is used to create a relationship between two tables and enforce\n",
    "referential integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Establishes a relationship between two tables\n",
    "Can contain duplicate values\n",
    "Can accept NULL values\n",
    "Helps maintain data consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Departments (\n",
    "    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "     EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "     Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "     DepartmentID INT,\n",
    "     FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, DepartmentID in the Employees table is a foreign key that references the\n",
    "DepartmentID column in the Departments table."

    "\n",
    "Joins in SQL are used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column\n",
    "between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Joins:\n",
    "---------------\n",

    "4.FULL JOIN – Returns all rows from both tables (matching and non-matching).\n",
    "5.SELF JOIN – Joins a table with itself.\n",
    "6.CROSS JOIN – Returns the Cartesian product of both tables (all possible combinations).\n",
